A way for a remote SPOT to connect over the radio to a program on a host computer that will
record and display telemetry data sent by the remote SPOT.
<p>
This is a demo application that provides the basic framework for collecting data on a remote SPOT 
and passing it over the radio to a host application that can record and display it.
<p>
The framework shows how the remote SPOT and the host application can locate each other by the 
use of broadcast packets. A point-to-point radio connection is then established and used to 
pass commands and replies between the host application and the remote SPOT.
<p> 
The SPOT application consists of two Java classes: one to handle the radio connection 
to the host application, and the second to read the accelerometer and send the data to the host
application. 
<p>
Two auxiliary classes are also used: one to provide the basic application framework and the 
other to listen for commands over the USB connection (so you do not have to push the reset
button when deploying a new application).
